<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology which enables a machine to simulate human behaviour. Machine Learning (ML) a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically learn from past data without programming explicitly. ML algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.</p>
<p>RVR & JC College of Engineering offers a 4-year Under Graduate B. Tech., CSE (AI &amp; ML) programme with the intake of 60 seats with the academic year 2021-2022 and increased intake of 180 seats from the academic year 2022-23. </p>
<p>Graduates of B.Tech., in CSE (AI & ML) will acquire Computer Science & Engineering skills with an added expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to work across many domains, including medicine, finance, robotics, and business intelligence.</p>
